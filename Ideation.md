# Custom SSG

### What do we need?
- My SSG:
    - A `.md` to `HTML` converter
    - A simple way to convert private repo into a directed tree (for site navigation).
- A way to host:
    - Could try cloud-VMs.
    - Problem: not a cent to spare.
- Future Ideas:
    - Custom Styling + Light/Dark Mode Toggling.

### Short-Term Solution
- Use GitHub Pages for Hosting and Python's `markdown` to parse.
- Focus only on how you should handle site direction and styling.
