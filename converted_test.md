**1.32.5**<br>
>***अह॑न्वृ॒त्रं वृ॑त्र॒तरं॒ व्यं॑स॒मिन्द्रो॒ वज्रे॑ण मह॒ता व॒धेन॑ ।***<br>
***स्कन्धां॑सीव॒ कुलि॑शेना॒ विवृ॒क्णाहि॑: शयत उप॒पृक्पृ॑थि॒व्याः ॥***<br>


**Translation:—**<br>
Indra slew Vrtra, the Unshouldered Dark One,<br>
With the Vajra, the mighty weapon.<br>
Thus did the Wyrm lie upon the Eorth,<br>
As trunks of trees slashed by an axe.<br>


**Sayanacharya’s Commentary—**<br>
Ahi and Vṛtra are synonyms of megha, a cloud.<br>


**Draupadeya’s Notes—**<br>
“vyaṃsam” = (accusative singular) “(He who is) Broad-Shouldered, Bereft of Shoulders”<br>
The ambiguity is due to the nature of the “vi” prefix— it can imply that the modified word is“spread apart”, it can negate it, or even affirm it. As such, I chose that Vrtra be shoulderless— it makes sense as he is a Wyrm. This, however, goes against most interpretations. Only the interlinear translation by Sri Aurobindo’s followers is with me:<br>


—<br>
Indra  killed Vritra , the most Vritra , shoulderless , by lightning , by a great stroke;<br>
like a tree trunk cut in pieces by an axe, the Serpent  lies adhering to Earth<br>
—<br>


“vadhena” = (instrumental) “weapon”<br>


“kuliśenā” = (instrumental) “axe<br>
