# MySSG

Heya! You're currently looking at a WIP project based on this video by 
≈Åukasz Langa: [Type Annotations Make Coding Better At Any Size, or: Writing a Static Site Generator in 30 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNKFcB8hUu4&t=518s). As such, this README.md will be properly updated once development is 70% done.

So, in lieu of a common README.md, allow me to offer to you all my current ideation:

# Custom SSG

### What do we need?
- My SSG:
    - A `.md` to `HTML` converter
    - A simple way to convert private repo into a directed tree (for site navigation).
- A way to host:
    - Could try cloud-VMs.
    - Problem: not a cent to spare.
- Future Ideas:
    - Custom Styling + Light/Dark Mode Toggling.

### Short-Term Solution
- Use GitHub Pages for Hosting and Python's `markdown` to parse.
- Focus only on how you should handle site direction and styling.

This README.md will be updated in due time. Thanks for visiting!
