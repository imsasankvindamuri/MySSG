**1.32.5**
>***अह॑न्वृ॒त्रं वृ॑त्र॒तरं॒ व्यं॑स॒मिन्द्रो॒ वज्रे॑ण मह॒ता व॒धेन॑ ।***
***स्कन्धां॑सीव॒ कुलि॑शेना॒ विवृ॒क्णाहि॑: शयत उप॒पृक्पृ॑थि॒व्याः ॥***

**Translation:—**
Indra slew Vrtra, the Unshouldered Dark One,
With the Vajra, the mighty weapon.
Thus did the Wyrm lie upon the Eorth,
As trunks of trees slashed by an axe.

**Sayanacharya’s Commentary—**
Ahi and Vṛtra are synonyms of megha, a cloud.

**Draupadeya’s Notes—**
“/vyaMsam|” = (accusative singular) “(He who is) Broad-Shouldered, Bereft of Shoulders”
The ambiguity is due to the nature of the “vi” prefix— it can imply that the modified word is“spread apart”, it can negate it, or even affirm it. As such, I chose that Vrtra be shoulderless— it makes sense as he is a Wyrm. This, however, goes against most interpretations. Only the interlinear translation by Sri Aurobindo’s followers is with me:

—
Indra  killed Vritra , the most Vritra , shoulderless , by lightning , by a great stroke;
like a tree trunk cut in pieces by an axe, the Serpent  lies adhering to Earth
—

“/vadhena|” = (instrumental) “weapon”

“/kulizenA|” = (instrumental) “axe”
